Git should already be installed on your virtual machine in the DSH. 

Click on `Start` then hover over `Git` to open up `Git Bash`. 

We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you type `pwd` (for "print working directory") into Git Bash now you should get back `/n/Desktop`, meaning that you are working in the Desktop on your N drive.
